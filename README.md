# DAOTown ðŸš€

Managing DAOs requires technical expertise, creating high entry barriers and inefficiencies. Our project aims to streamline DAO activities, including governance and tokenomics, through a decentralized infrastructure. By lowering these barriers, we enhance accessibility and efficiency, enabling broader participation and user-friendly DAO management for communities, organizations, and individuals.

```bash
forge install
```

#### Building the Project

Build the project with the following command:

```bash
make build
```

#### Deployment

The Makefile is set up for deployment on NeoX T4 Testnet.

```bash
make deploy ARGS="--network neox"
```

## Frontend Setup ðŸš§

**Note:** Update the compiled ABIs of the contracts in the `/frontend/src/utils/abis/` directory.

1. From the root, navigate to the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
cd DAOTown/frontend/

3. Refer to `.env.example` to update the `.env` file.

4. Install Dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

5. Run the project at `localhost:3000`:

```bash
yarn run dev
```
